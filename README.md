## Project Summary

What is Diabetes? 

![Diabetes-Type-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53684246/141233846-552ec140-4a15-4073-b62e-b26c582efe81.jpg)

[Diabetes](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes) is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.

Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes.” These terms suggest that someone doesn’t really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.

## Data Cleaninng

The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, skin thickness, and so on.

   - Pregnacies: Number of times pregnant
   - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   - Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   - Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   - Diabetes Pedigree: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
   - Age: Age in years
   - Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

``` Aging is by far the strongest known risk factor of diabetes mellitus in the USA. In this graph, we can observe that the risk of diabetes disease can either be in young population or older but predominantly among those people age 45 years or older. They are more at risk for developing type 2 diabetes because as you get older, insulin secretion decreases, and changes in your body composition make it more insulin resistant. Both of these can lead to high blood sugar levels.```
