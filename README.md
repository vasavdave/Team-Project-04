## Project Summary

What is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.

Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes.” These terms suggest that someone doesn’t really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.

* In this project, the objective is to predict whether the person has Diabetes or not based on various features such as:
    - Pregnancies
    - Insulin Level
    - Age
    - BMI

## Data Sources

This dataset is originally from the [National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases](https://repository.niddk.nih.gov/home/). The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

## Data Cleaninng

The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

   - Pregnacies: Number of times pregnant
   - Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
   - Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
   - Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
   - Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
   - BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
   - Diabetes Pedigree: Diabetes pedigree function
   - Age: Age in years
   - Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
